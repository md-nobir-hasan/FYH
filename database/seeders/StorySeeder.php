I saw that Switzerland combines all the attributes of an ideal country: beautiful nature, a fair state structure, a high standard of living, a huge number of career prospects, a very good geographical location and much more. At that time, I also loved Dubai and spent almost all my vacations in this city. However, in 2021 I decided to spend my vacation in Switzerland and did not regret it.

                                    Finally, after a lot of dedication and perseverance, I managed to get my recognition as a doctor in Switzerland. And just as Thomas had said, he extended his helping hand, and with his support, I started a new chapter in Switzerland.<br class='str-br'><br class='str-br'>

                                    It's been one year since I made that decision, and I can confidently say that I am happy with my choice. Switzerland has embraced me, and I feel appreciated for my skills and expertise.<br class='str-br'><br class='str-br'>

                                    Looking back on this incredible journey, I cherish the moments of struggle and the courage it took to overcome all the obstacles. Switzerland has become my home, and I'm grateful for the support and friendship of Thomas, who played a significant role in my success.<br class='str-br'><br class='str-br'>

                                    Now, I stand tall and proud, grateful for the opportunities that came my way. This is a story of determination, friendship, and finding fulfillment in following my heart despite the challenges I faced.

I experience the quality of life and medical care here as a clear quantum leap for the better than before.<br class='str-br single'>
                                In the meantime, I have changed jobs, although Thomas already had an eye on whether we would fit together when choosing the first one. That was what it seemed like at first, but then I realized that I needed something else to be happy at work.<br class='str-br single'>
                                Yes, I could have taken care of it myself, but I handed the task of looking for a job over to Thomas again, because he can use his contacts to better assess where I fit in under the changed requirements.<br class='str-br single'>
                                Here, too, I had 3 suggestions within a week from which one crystallized and what can I say, that fits like a glove, laugh. The nice thing is that I wouldn't even have had to move if I hadn't wanted to. Same region, great tasks and yes, although it wasn't my goal, an even better salary.<br class='str-br single'>
                                Oh well, Thomas and I became friends over time, because Thomas just takes care of things, keeps in touch and asks how things are going. In an honest exchange with each other and keeping in touch, it has shown that we tick pretty much the same way.<br class='str-br single'>
                                So I can only advise anyone who is interested or who is just thinking about coming to Switzerland to contact a reputable recruiter if possible. Based on my experiences with the first company that seemed competent at first glance, I naturally recommend Thomas.<br class='str-br single'>
